# **Text-based Adventure Game**

I want to make a text-based adventure game.

I hope to create a text-based simulation that offers branching choices for the player to select to continue the story. I want to add a save function where the user can save their progress and select their save file from a list of saves to continue their game.
## Application details:

- This application would allow the user to play an adventure game, where items can be picked up and stored in a list in order to be used later in the run.
- People who want to play an adventure game will use this application
- This project is of interest to me because I enjoy playing games, and I love writing stories. 

## User Stories
