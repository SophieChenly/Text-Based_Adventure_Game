# **Snake**

I want to make an application that runs *Snake*, where the user controls a snake to move around a 2D space collecting food. With each piece of food consumed, the snake will grow in size. The snake cannot touch itself or the boundaries of the game. The goal of the game is to fill the whole screen with snake.

I hope to allow the user to make their own snake, name it, and give it a colour. Once created, the snake will be added to a log where the user can select their snake to play the same snake in the future.

## Application details:

- This application would allow the user to play the game *Snake*
- People who want to play the *Snake* will use this application
- This project is of interest to me because I have a personal goal of creating a *Snake* game in every programming language I could.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to play the game *Snake*
- As a user, I want to create my own snake with a unique colour and name
- As a user, I want to add my snake to a list of created snakes, and be able to select my snake to play as in the game
- As a user, I want to see my score as I am playing the game, and after I win or lose the game.
- As a user, I want to be able to see the high scores of my snake.
