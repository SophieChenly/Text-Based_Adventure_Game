# **Text-based Adventure Game**

I want to make a text-based adventure game.

I hope to create a text-based simulation that offers branching choices for the player to select to continue the story. I want to add a save function where the user can save their progress and select their save file from a list of saves to continue their game.
## Application details:

- This application would allow the user to play an adventure game, where items can be picked up and stored in a list in order to be used later in the run.
- People who want to play an adventure game will use this application
- This project is of interest to me because I enjoy playing games, and I love writing stories. 

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to play an adventure game with a branching storyline.
- As a user, I want to be able to add items into my inventory.
- As a user, I want to be able to win or lose the game.
- As a user, I want to be able to make choices that influence the course of the story.
- As a user, I want to be able to save my game.
- As a user, I want to be able to reload my latest save.

## Instructions for Grader

- You can generate the first required event related to adding weapons to the inventory by clicking on the inventory button at the bottom of your screen, clicking it, and click the "add a useless weapon" button. Here you will be able to see items added to your inventory, as well as previously picked up items. (To pick up items, just progress through the game. You will have an option to grab an item at the beginning and in the first floor of the Nest.) ((Resize the windows if necessary))
- You can locate the second required event related to adding weapons to the inventory by clicking on the inventory button again (you can do this with or without items in the inventory). On the right of the item list, you will find a stat that shows you the strongest weapon in your inventory based on their weapon damage. You will see its weapon damage right beside it. Weapon damage numbers are slightly randomized, so feel free to click around and see how strong each weapon is.
- You can locate my visual component in the main story screen by running the application as well as the game over screen. The UBC logo is not my creation and I am acknowledging here that it is the intellectual property of the University of British Columbia.
- You can save the state of the application by clicking on the save game button. (Inventory items will be saved)
- You can load the state of the application by clicking on the load game button.
